# Document Analysis and Image Comparison Application

This application, written in GoLang, takes input fields, a selfie, and a picture of a document and uses AWS services to compare the text in the document image to the input values and compare the image in the document to the selfie.

## Features

- Extracts text from a document image using Amazon Textract.
- Compares the extracted text with the input values provided by the user.
- Uses Amazon Rekognition to compare the image in the document with the selfie.
- Provides results indicating the match or mismatch between the document and the input values.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to access Amazon Textract and Amazon Rekognition services.
- Go programming language installed on your development machine.
- AWS SDK for Go installed.
- Docker installed

## Usage

## Architecture

- Backend: Written in GoLang, the backend server receives requests from the API endpoints,
  
  interacts with AWS services (Amazon Textract and Amazon Rekognition)
  
  to perform document analysis and image comparison, and returns the results.
